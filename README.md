# PyUnitTest

A [VSTS](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/) build task for executing unit tests against a [Python 3](https://python.org) code base and collecting coverage information. It creates a virtual environment to be executed in and restores an environment based on a requirements file.

##Â Roadmap

* Initial version which executes tests and provides coverage information [*Done*]
* Additional platform support
* Improved simplified report page
* Improve error handling
* Add tests
